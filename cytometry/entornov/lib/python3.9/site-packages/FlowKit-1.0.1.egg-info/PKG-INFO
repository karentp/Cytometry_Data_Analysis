        ## Overview
        
        FlowKit is a Python toolkit for flow cytometry analysis and visualization, with full support for the [GatingML 2.0 standard](http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/gating/latest.pdf) and limited support for FlowJo 10 workspace files.

        ## Requirements
        
        FlowKit supports Python version 3.7 - 3.10. All dependencies are installable 
        via pip, and are listed below.
        
        > **NOTE**: FlowUtils uses C extensions for significant performance improvements. For most platforms and Python versions, pre-built binaries are available in PyPI (i.e. installable via `pip`). 
        >
        > If a pre-built binary of FlowUtils is not available for your environment, the C extensions must be compiled using the source package. NumPy >=1.19 must be installed prior to compiling FlowUtils. If compiling using `gcc`, version 5 or later is required.
        
        Required Python dependencies:
        
        * [flowio](https://github.com/whitews/flowio) == 1.1.1
        * [flowutils](https://github.com/whitews/flowutils) == 1.0.0
        * anytree >= 2.6
        * bokeh >= 2.4, <3.0
        * lxml >= 4.7
        * matplotlib >= 3.5
        * networkx >= 2.3
        * numpy >= 1.20
        * pandas >= 1.2
        * psutils >= 5.8
        * scipy >= 1.6
        * seaborn >= 0.11, <0.12
        
        ## Installation
        
        > **NOTE**: For macOS users running on Apple Silicon, the version of `pip` may need to be upgraded prior to installing FlowKit in order to install the required dependencies.
        
        ### From PyPI
        
        ```
        pip install flowkit
        ```
        
        ### From source
        
        Clone the repository and ensure `pip` is up-to-date. It is recommended to use `pip` to install requirements as relying on `setuptools` may result in incompatible dependency versions.
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/whitews/flowkit
        cd flowkit
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
