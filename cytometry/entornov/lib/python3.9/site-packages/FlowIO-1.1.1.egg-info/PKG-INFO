        ## Overview
        
        FlowIO is a Python library for reading / writing Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) 
        files and has zero external dependencies. FlowIO is compatible with Python 3.7+ (FlowIO v0.9.9 was the last release supporting Python 2). 
        
        FlowIO retrieves event data exactly as it is encoded in the FCS file: as a 
        1-dimensional list without separating the events into channels or performing any preprocessing (e.g. applying gain). However, all the metadata 
        stored in the FCS file is available as a dictionary via the 'text' attribute. Basic attributes
        are also available for commonly accessed properties. For example, the channel count 
        can be used to easily convert the event data to a multi-column NumPy array:
        
        ```
        import flowio
        import numpy
        
        fcs_data = flowio.FlowData('example.fcs')
        npy_data = numpy.reshape(fcs_data.events, (-1, fcs_data.channel_count))
        ```
        
        For higher level interaction with flow cytometry data, including GatingML and FlowJo 10 support, 
        see the related [FlowKit](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit) project.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The recommended way to install FlowIO is via the `pip` command:
        
        ```
        pip install flowio
        ```
        
        Or, if you prefer, you can install from the GitHub source:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/whitews/flowio
        cd flowio
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
