FlowUtils is a Python package containing various utility functions related
to flow cytometry analysis, primarily focused on compensation,
transformation, and gating tasks commonly used within the flow community.

FlowUtils is part of a suite of Python libraries for analyzing flow 
cytometry data.  It was developed as an extension to the light-weight 
[FlowIO library](https://github.com/whitews/FlowIO). FlowIO reads and 
writes Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files, and has zero dependencies. 
For higher level interaction with flow cytometry data, including 
GatingML & FlowJo 10 support, see the related 
[FlowKit project](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit).

## Installation

***Note: FlowUtils uses C extensions for significant performance 
improvements. For the most common platforms and Python versions, pre-built
binaries are available in PyPI (and installable via pip).***

***If a pre-built binary of FlowUtils is not available for your environment,
then the C extensions must be compiled using the source package. NumPy 
must be installed prior to compiling FlowUtils. If compiling using `gcc`, version 5 or later is required.***

***Compiling FlowUtils from source can also result in NumPy C API incompatibilities. [See the NumPy docs for more information](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/depending_on_numpy.html#understanding-numpy-s-versioning-and-api-abi-stability).***
